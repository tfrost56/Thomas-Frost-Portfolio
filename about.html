               <p class="profile__text">My name is Tom Frost and I'm a self-taught web developer based in Oxfordshire, UK. 
                    Having previously worked as a Travel Consultant, I have excellent personal skills and a strong understanding 
                    of how businesses work; however, I realised that I no longer saw my future in the travel industry.
                    Therefore, in December 2019, I decided to pursue my dream of learning computer programming and web development, 
                    with the ultimate goal of transitioning into a career in web development. As of December 2020 I have been working 
                    as a Junior Web Developer at a company in Witney, Oxfordshire, learning and improving my self taught knowledge.</p>

                <p class="profile__text">  
                    The beginning of my journey has been fixated on front-end technologies, however after delveloping a good understanding of css and Javascript
                    I have learnt a great deal about PHP and how it intergreates with many modern content management systems. So Throughout the past year I've essentially
                    been a junior full stack developer which has been facinating to learn about. I still find that my eye for detail and enjoyment of watching a page come to life
                    is where my passion lies. However venturing into backend code has improved my overall understanding of code to no end. I have also found that my 
                    commercial experience as helped greatly with project management and fantastic customer feedback. The abilty to code but also be personable and invested 
                    in the customer allows me to offer somethign different, I always think about the big picture and what I can do for the company long term.
